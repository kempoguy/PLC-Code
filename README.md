# PLC-Code
A collection of random PLC code I wrote over 20yrs as an OT engineer. At one point everything in here was live, was used and worked - no guarantees now though. To the best of my knowledge, every machine represented in this code has been decommissioned and is no longer is use.

I don't have software to open these files any more so I can't offer any support or assistance in any way.
Most of these projects are very small scale. Except for one, they are all Allen Bradley Micrologix 1100, 1200, 1400, 1500 and maybe an old 1000 or two.

Licence is completely kurb-side - as is, where is, I am not responsible for what you find, what you do with it, or how many flames erupt from its use.

The programming architecture and engineering is unlikely to follow modern best practice as this all dates back to the early 2000's. 
None of it meets the secure PLC coding standards of today, or if it does, it's by sheer fluke.
